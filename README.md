# Tinky Winkey: A Windows Operating System Experiment

Welcome to Tinky Winkey! This project is all about diving into the Windows operating system, but don't worry, we're not going to bore you with textbook stuff. Instead, we're going to have some fun with services and keyloggers. So, let's break it down in a way that won't put you to sleep.

## What's This All About?

### Services
Okay, first things first. Imagine services as those sneaky background programs running on your computer. They're like secret agents, and they can do all sorts of things. In this project, we're going to create our own service called "tinky."

What can "tinky" do, you ask? Well, it can start a keylogger in the background. Yes, a keylogger, like the one they use in spy movies! But don't worry, we're just doing this for educational purposes, not espionage.

### Keyloggers
Now, keyloggers are like nosy detectives for your keyboard. They watch every key you press and save it secretly. It's like having a diary of everything you type. We're going to create a keylogger called "winkey."

Our "winkey" keylogger is no ordinary snitch; it's smart. It knows what program you're using and records only the keys you press while you're using that program. And it does this all in the background, like a silent observer.

### Wait, Why Are We Doing This?

Good question! We're doing this to learn more about how the Windows operating system works under the hood. It's like peeking behind the curtains of a magic show to see how the tricks are done.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You'll need a Windows 10 or higher system. We want to make sure everything works smoothly, just like it did when we tested it.
- Set up a Virtual Machine. We don't want any accidents happening on your main system.
- Make sure you have C or C++ programming skills. That's the language we're using.
- Get ready to use the CL compiler and some specific flags. We like things just right.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your virtual machine.
2. Compile the `svc` and `winkey` programs.
3. Follow the examples in Chapter V to install, start, stop, and delete the "tinky" service.
4. Marvel at your newfound knowledge of Windows services and keyloggers!

## Bonus Round

Feeling adventurous? You can add some cool bonus features if you want. Maybe hide the service and keylogger, update the service while it's running, or even explore clipboard, screen, or microphone logging. It's up to you!

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute to this project and make it even more exciting. Just remember to keep it ethical and educational.

## Credits

This project is inspired by the Teletubbies and a curiosity about the Windows operating system. Thanks to Microsoft for providing those handy Virtual Machines!

Now, go ahead and explore the world of Windows services and keyloggers. Have fun, and don't worry; we're not spying on you!
